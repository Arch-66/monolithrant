	It's been one day since Independence day and I am still hearing some fireworks but it's not as Bad as yesterday. I'm honestly thankful that I got some sleep that day. I am writing this at the <br>
	End of the day or 9:56 PM, close to when I decide to go to bed. Anyway I decided to get some thoughts off my chest. Overtime I came to realize that the only people I ever get to interact with are my family <br>
	and My siblings and parents Who are all Jehovah's Witnesses. This ultimately lead me to The realization of how sheltered and socially Isolated I am. The closest thing I have to contact with the outside world is <br>
	Through the internet. This sudden realization put me in a week of sadness and depression. I no longer feel like I talk to people anymore. But more like people who pretend to be their own individuals. I also am homeschooled <br>
	Now all I care about is talking is talking to a human being who cares about me and is not part of some cult group thinking. I wished my VR headset was still working, when It did it made me feel like I was truly talking to different people. <br>
	Of course even though I knew it wasn't truly a physical experience I was still talking to people at the end of the day. Right now I am planning my escape and how I will navigate my ever sooner adult life. <br>
	Will I get married, have kids, have a roommate, stuff like that. Will I go to college? I thought about staying with my parents as much as I cannot stand them. But admittely my Life would stay on easy mode. <br>
	I ultimately just want a chill and relax life with friends, time for my hobbies, Healthy community, and just a life in general. I thought how I could achieve that if I moved out. One thing however that makes me a little worried <br>
	is how many young adults are frustrated with their new adult life in the real world. Frustrated and stressed out by 9-5 Shifts, Bad paychecks, Expensive college Loans, Trouble dating, etc. And it honestly kinda scares me just a little. <br>
	That with bills, rent, inflation.. If I lived with my parents I won't have to worry about all that. I can still have a life and go out and meet my mates. In theory that could work out but In reality I'll guess we'll see when that time comes. <br>
	That or I could stay with them until I can get enough money to sustain myself.

	Well, Im at the first part of the meeting now at the convention. The Drive took a while. It felt longer than the last time we drived to the convention. Right now the speaker is ranting about <br>
	how "Evil" and Cruel the World is. Haha not us who protect pedophiles Shun Gay Members of Jehovah's Witnesses. Before the talk started, a video of a music video played. It reminded me of North korean propaganda. <br>
	In North Korea they have their own TV channel for citizens that is basically propaganda. It shows the most sanitized, filtered footage of what goes on in NK. It shows only the "happiest" of people. The pretty's of places <br>
	And the best of moments all for outsiders to look at it. The music video was pretty much like that. It is so filtered its insane. It shows only smiles on the screen, The sunniest of days, etc. <br>
	The way the speaker talks is like they are so confident and yet so wrong. It is an organization of con-mans and I am here for it. I wanna see it fall and see the trains crash onto each other. I actually have a theory on why they talk the way they do. <br>
	Jehovah's Witnesses have a long history of its founders being linked to freemasonry. It's funny because its the exact group they demonize. Freemasons are often very well spoken (Taught directly or indirectly). <br>
	Freemasons have also been known to host workshops on being well spoken and talking in a certain way to drive a message across. Now I'm not saying all GB members are freemasons but I have a theory that some of them could be. <br>
	
	<br>
	They are often taught to be well spoken (The speakers) Governing body member samuel herd was wearing a watch with a freemason symbol on it. Now to be fair we don't know whether it was a fake or was the real watch we speculated <br>
	but it sure as hell was not 'modest' and still had a masonry symbol on it. Hey Speaking of blingy stuff, Stephan lett have been known to do that exact thing multiple times and wearing shiny watches and chains on his tie. <br>
	Its scummy and disgusting especially when you take note that lots of Jehovah's witnesses are often low class and among the least of educated. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. <br>
	Anyway as I am writing this they are showing a Bible Drama that has kinda been poked fun at by the ExJW community. Its kinda silly right now but I will give it a fair chance. it is crazy the things people do all for a <br>
	delusion.

	I decided not to write a entry This time when I was their. I just didn't feel like It Plus, I was too damn Depressed. Although I feel much better now. Its 05:21 PM. We just had foo-sacklys. <br>
	And currently almost there to home with only we have to stop at the gas station first (We actually didn't luckily, writing this much later from my home). I feel relieved knowing that I don't have to deal with this no more. <br>
	Not until next year at least.. I'll have more time for studying and personal projects. Suddenly those midweek meetings and regular meetings (however vague that maybe) no longer sounds so bad anymore. <br>
	Conventions actually make me super miserable. I guess I should give it a little review? I give The 2023 Convention a 2/10. Shitty Drama, Full Of shit Speakers Talking down to the "Young Ones" and as always <br>
	using extremely manipulative tactics to control its members but that is what high control groups do and Jehovah's witnesses are sadly among one of them. I find of need to get some stuff off my chest <br>
	Its nice knowing that I don't have to wake up early just to watch long sessions of Manipulative propaganda that continues to blind my family every. single. day. I'm just gonna rest after those emotional and intense 3 days <br>
	
	<br>
	But as a sidenote just out of boredom I kinda just started recording out of random moments and even had a voice recording. This footage shows snippets on what was going on in the Convention. Just out of safety I won't show where this was taken place at. <br>

   As Time goes on one thing I am starting to realize is that I no longer go on the internet with a purpose. Now its just a thing I use to more or less to pass time. Back when I was <br>
   much younger (Like 8 or 7) I would use the internet with a purpose: To simply just explore. Or to watch my favorite gaming channel or too check up on a blog to satisfy <br>
   Curiosity. But now I no longer do that. Now its just I wake up and go on youtube.. But the question I always ask myself is "Then what? What are you gonna do?"     <br>
   I noticed that the quality of the content that was on the internet has really started to go down. Now If you go on youtube and see the recommended page its just a bunch of <br>
   of absolute repetitive sameness slob. There is nothing new there. There is absolutely nothing new going on reddit, twitter, or anything. The Internet was not what it was like <br>
   before. There was always something new to explore. Weird threads in 4chan, Crazy arguments in reddit comments, etc, Funny gaming videos. Perhaps this is because I've gotten <br>
   older and so it doesn't feel as new to me anymore. I don't exactly feel that I have a purpose of going on youtube anymore other than to just fill time in. This brings too me <br>
   A New topic. The Topic of a mental health crisis that has been going on. What is all so strange about the crisis is that no one seems to fully know what is happening in our <br>
   <br>
   Modern Times. However I suppose a Theory (Again a Theory, not fact). There are lots of people who have problems with social media where they will do what is known as "doom scrolling" <br>
   . Basically opening up twitter or some social media app and just scroll on random people's posts on and on and on until they want or have to do something else. People's lives are boiling <br>
   down to this: Wake up, Go to your job, come home, Scroll endlessly on the internet, Sleep. Then wake up, Go to your job, come home, scroll endlessly on the internet, sleep. Then just <br>
   Rinse and Repeat over and over and over again. What is interesting about human beings is that if you have them do something repeatly and let them have it be their whole life and have <br>
   that being feel like there is no purpose in their life or the life that they live.. Well.. They start to go crazy. I feel like lots of people are tired of that. Lots of people Are unfullfilled  <br>
   
   <br>
   Because they know that life is boring. Imagine doing that for you're whole life. its like thats the "Dream life" I was promised? Another thing that brings to my mind is something called the <br>
   Dead Internet Theory. Basically in a NutShell its the theory that as AI gets more and more advanced eventually it will kinda just "take over" the internet. What that means is, Is basically <br>
   AI replacing content creators and making videos, all photos and pictures on the internet are gonna be AI generated, all websites are gonna be AI generated, music, etc. This actually scares <br>
   The hell out of me because it could very well be the case. There is a Interesting site called websim.io which basically simulates this very thing. it has its own AI and you the user has to <br>
   Give it a prompt on what website you want it to make. Something as vague as like: "make a social media website". And it will spit it out really well. Not to mention AI can infact already <br>
   Create Videos, (couple channels doing that right now actually) Check out OpenAI's Newest Model: Sora its absolutely insane. It can also generate super realistic videos that look like <br>
   actual fucking footage of real life.

   its truly scary on how likely this could actually be a thing. And it would make the internet even worse than it is.. A Question would also be on how AI could effect deep deep parts of the <br>
   Internet? <br>

    Oh and just because I have too I will suppose a Theory about AI Image generation. I think it is no surprise that AI can potentially help us not only learn about machine learning <br>
    and the capabilities that it has, but also about us. About Humans and the human brain. The "AI" that we know of is more just ML (machine learning) that can predict based on patterns. <br>
    This is pretty much how we as human beings learn. When we are taught about our ABC's we take note that its always "abc" never "cba" or "bac" or of something of the sort. <br>
    When we learn to do math through patterns. if we learn multiplication for example we will take note of the pattern between individuals who know how to multiply and how they do it. <br>
    Which then that bleeds over into when we try to do multiplcation problems. AI is also run off Neroun networks which help us see patterns. (All just like human beings, Us). <br>
    
    <br>

   And so what? You see there is a problem with AI Image generation that In my opinion may or may not be solved for a long time until we get a more indepth knowledge of the human mind. <br>
   Specifically the Imagination. Know that this is just a theory and so I could be ignorant and be completely incorrect. But here is what I suggest. You see when we imagine things, the image <br>
   Is NEVER perfect. For example you could probably imagine a apple right now in your hand but you may also notice that maybe the stem is not entirely correct or "complete". Maybe the shape <br>
   Looks a little weird maybe the coloring is off and so on. This is with all things when we imagine. Even people who can visualize insanely well will always get this feeling that the picture <br>
   is never "complete". Maybe some parts of the image are blurred, or not as vivid, Or incorrect, etc. This problem gets even worse with when you imagine complex things like a forest or a <br>
   house. <br>

  <br>

   What I am saying is that AI perhaps may pretty much simulate the Human imagination except the only difference is that it is outputted into a external thing that as humans we can see. <br>
   And so when AI hits those blurred or said not so vivid parts it may do what is called "AI hallunication" where it will just make stuff up in it. This can explain why AI is horrible at <br>
   drawing stuff like fingers. You're more than likely having a hard time doing that completely in your head and or maybe only have a very faint but vague image in your head. <br>

    As Time goes on I get more and more aware of something known as project 2025. I really hate this, it scares me to the core of my being. Something known as the American heritage foundation <br>
    is as described commonly as a "conservative think tank" (which I couldn't agree more) and has founded something called Project 2025 which aims to abolish Abortion, Birth control <br> 
    LGBTQ+ Rights, And even erase the department of education as well as a whole slew of things that violate freedom. This is truly scary to me. One thing that I love above everything else <br>
    even my own family is.. Freedom! <br>

    <br>    

    I really cannot live without freedom, and I'm honestly worried if this is gonna pass into action. Sadly there is not much I can do about this other than <br>
    just vote blue and hope Trump doesn't win. I actually do not like Biden but seeing this side of right wing extremeism has brought me new eyes of just how corrupt and full of shit <br>
    The Far right are. What's even stranger is how lots of people voting for Trump don't even seem to be too aware of what it is or even heard of it. This is honestly a national threat to <br>
    democracy as well and will bring about facism. <br>

    <br>

     I seriously doubt this will play into effect as I seriously don't think its this easy to turn a country into a facist party. But <br>
    it's always best to think it could happen and fight against it. This is so honestly fucking disgusting and just violates human decency. <br>
    My dad believes in a whole lot of conspiracy theorys including but not limited too: 9/11 being a inside job by america, Moon landing being faked <br>
    , But also The FBI wants to go after Trump. <br>

    <img width="320" height="240" src="dangit.jpg">
    <span style="color:#FF2929">D</span><span style="color:#94FF29">a</span><span style="color:#29FFFF">r</span><span style="color:#9429FF">n</span>

    <br>

    I'm honestly not so sure if this is true (most likely not, CT are false more often than true anyway) then the FBI is making the right <br>
    Decision. I'm sure the FBI knows for a fact that once Trump gets elected its game over for the united states. The Thing is, Is that the united states kinda runs the whole world <br>
    In a funny way. Nations like to typically copy US (Pun intended) but of course leave out the parts that they don't like. <br>

    if Project 2025 doesn't pass the public will mostly forget about it. However I honestly think its good as a society to learn form history on just how close we could have been to a <br>
    Truly facist country. With that being said I decided to archive the ongoing Title covering Project 2025 and its plans: "Mandate for leadership - The conservative promise (25)". <br>
    This Copy came from the American heritage foundation and it is 922 pages long so it is quite a long one. If everything goes well this shall be archived and distributed for centurys <br>
    upon centurys! <br>

    Woah! Something crazy Just happened. I woke this morning to findout that a cybersecurity firm named CrowdStrike has came out and said a "defect" in their system was the cause of <br>
    Worldwide chaos. Like 1B Workmachines around the globe (Or at least in the US) are straight up just not working anymore giving a blue screen of death. This has caused to the U.S <br>
    economy to worsen, Millions of airports have to shut down. Others that have to shut down are banks, hospitals, media outlets and other businesses. Its crazy! This is basically <br>
    Y2K happening all over again. <br>

    <br>

    <img width="320" height="240" src="crowdstrike1.png">

    What seems to be the case is that the only people that are safe from this are mac and Linux users. Whatover seemed to happen was the Program (crowdstrike falcon sensor) runs at a kernel <br>
    Level. This is pretty darn important because not only does it sit at the kernel level it sits at a billion of windows device's kernels. And because some unsafe code in the kernel now <br>
    resides their, It ultimately broke the windows Kernel as well resulting in the BSOD worldwide. This of course is a oversimplication of what actually happened but in a nutshell this is it. <br>
    I do kinda wonder on if it has or if it will effect me or my parents in some way or shape of form..

    So far this is not effecting me or my family too much. However it has shut down some parts of my mom's job to the point where it is a bit of a problem. I feel terrible for the people <br>
    Who's lives are on the line and yet because the 911 services are down they have no way to reach for help. It's honestly so messed up. Whats so strange about this is, Is really that <br>
    At the end of the day, It could have all been avoided. They could have tested this on some machine or had a early access version for testing reasons and could have found that bug <br>
    Easily and the world would have been saved. But I guess not? I was recently talking to my dad this morning and he just dropped a new conspiracy theory. He now believes that this <br>
    Was done intentionally to distract from Trump almost being shot. I had the biggest eyeroll of my life. I kind of hate it when my dad opens his mouth, he's a great guy but man <br>
    He's a mumbling moron sometimes. And he also believes that Mr.Yehweh protected Trump from the bullet. <br>

    <br>

    Its just flat out bullshit claims with no way to test them and no base. I honestly do think about switching to Linux as a desktop ever since this has happened. That along with the Windows <br>
    Recall thing.. Linux is just faster as well. Right now I only use it as a web server for this but not as a desktop. Not much is really happening today other than the fact that its raining <br>
    kinda hard. I hope the feds aren't seething as they read this. Go talk to my dad not me..

    I've Finally decided to just stop using the Internet passively with no goal. I'm so done with being a slave to a short attention span and the constant need for stimulation. <br>
    It used to be where I could literally just sit in my room and stare at a wall all day and to go into worlds with my own and focus on stuff for long periods of time. <br>
    I no longer can do that anymore and that kinda sucks. Its effecting how I listen to people, How and much I learn, etc. Now I just want everything instantly which of course is a problem. <br>
    I'll still use the internet I'm not a technophobe. But I'll use it with a purpose. One with a goal. Whether thats as simple as checking up on my favorite youtube channel, Downloading <br>
    A Book or album. But one thing I won't put up with anymore is instant short forms of content and just endless scrolling that gets me no where to completing my agenda. <br>

    <br>

    Right now I'm all I'm doing is kinda just well Journaling and working on my website and just thinking to myself. It makes me feel more happier than watching a youtube short so hey. <br>
    But of course that constant need for stimulation is still there. I never really realized that feeling. I only felt that once I actually was just sitting around and doing nothing. <br>

    So for the first ever I decided to just stop using the Internet passively and mindlessly. And now that its pretty much time for me to head to sleep I should record a few thoughts <br>
    Of Mine. One thing I am realizing is how dependent I have become on it. A lot of my opinions have come from Individuals sharing Their opinions on the Internet which has stopped <br>
    Me from learning how to Think on my own. I also have trouble with my own attention span which not only effects just in a general sense how long I pay attention and care about stuff <br>
    But also how I listen and communicate with people. <br>

    It has also affected How I learn stuff. If I am learning a Library or framework of some sort for a Programming Project I will often look into the docs and skip most of it <br>
    And just look only for the parts that will directly and quickly give me the answers and ignore the other rest of the important information. This has led me to have trouble <br>
    Grasping needed concepts and overall getting the answer I am looking for. And just overall I could of spend most of this time on stuff thats actually more fulfilling and <br>
    Enjoyable. So today has kinda been rough for the most part I just sat around bored out of my mind. What's weird about it is that even though I was super bored I didn't <br>
    Want to do anything..? <br>

    <br>

    I didn't want to read, I didn't want to write or study but I also didn't want to be bored and found myself with a urge to just "check up" on whats going on. <br>
    Overall I feel like something is just missing in my life without constantly using The net which also just goes to further my point on how dependent I am on it. <br>
    Overall Im very curious to see how this will pan out over a week or 2. Its a little hard right now but at the sametime I feel the boredness almost comforting in <br>
    A Weird Way? I'm not frightened by constant fear mongering news or any of that. <br>

    <br>

    What's interesting is that I think Terry A Davis also didn't really use the Internet as much as a lot of people do these days. Terry often Talked about how people No longer <br>
    Have freetime anymore and its just always trying to get themselves "busy" with stuff on social media. It was funny when he said that, It was one of the only times <br>
    He didn't sound like a complete schizo freak. Almost like he took his pills or something. The Truth is I think the Internet is a great tool. I would even go as far <br>
    As to say that the Internet is The Greatest invention of human history (Or one of them at least). Its just how it's being used by the public that is causing problems.. <br>

    <br>

    If this overall turns out to be a really good thing for me I think this will be how I live my life for the long While then. I would see no reason to go back. <br>
    The Question is if I will stick to it just long enough to give my "review" (if you will). Who Know's I guess. But its worthashot. So far everything outside <br>
    Of the Internet has been somewhat stimulating just no where near as stimulating as it. Like Reading a book for example is really darn boring. But Writing HTML code <br>
    (Like I am now) for Journaling is just more fun for some weird reason.

    <br>
    
    And to Add more to my already Long enough Journal Entry if you play older games Like Gta 4 and Gta san andreas. You can kinda just see that the world was a very different place <br>
    Without the Mainstream internet that we have today. It existed but it wasn't as invasive in our lives as it is now. And the whole thing just started out as a tool that served us. <br>
    But now we serve it instead. I wonder if AI will take this turn. IF AI does become mainstream and really does blow up (There's a chance it may not more on that later) it might just <br>
    just repeat the mistakes of history. AI is being used for lots of good and helpful reasons. (Some not so good but for the most part good which may be surprising to some) <br>
    
    <br>

    And so AI serves us at the moment but maybe just maybe if my predictions are correct We will serve it and its desires instead. But then again I'm not expert here. Anywho I'm tired from <br>
    all that. <br>

    I've been reading up on this book that's basically been exploring the idea of multiple personalitys and personas across many different people. I think its no stranger that we have <br>
    Challenges when it comes to reaching goals. Obstacles that get in our way. Whether thats Frustration, responsibilitys, Our Current Job, or whatever it is, it is their. <br>
    A Lot of us also have mental challenges. For example when presenting a talk, speech, or a lecture of somesort to a audience or a group of people we may feel nervous. Anxious <br>
    Of whether or not they will learn from it and take interest in it, Anxious on whether or not you are making a good impression on others, etc.

    <br>

    And more often than not those thoughts often hinder our performance than make us any better. Sometimes there are chances you have to take in order to reach said goal but because <br>
    You have a train of thought that is all about: "What if this, What if that!?" you never take that chance and you miss it. It's really all mental its all up here. <br>
    Lots of celebrities like Dwayne johnson and popular NFL Players and really any successful person you can think of all face those same exact challenges. Even when they "make it" <br>
    They have to continue "Making it" and therefore face those same mental challenges that often keep them from being among the top. <br>

    <br>

    And so what often happens if they create a alternate identity. One that abandons the original self and puts it on the sidelines for a little while and take on a new identity. One that <br>
    That is confident, One that is Focused, One that is dedicated or whatever traits it has that the original self doesn't. And so for example if you were to give a lecture but you are having <br>
    Those problems of nervousness, Doubt, Whether or not someone is gonna like you, etc you could take on a persona of another person. One that you feel emotionally tied to and can relate. <br>
    And you could "activate" that persona and the effects are wonderous! Your a completely seperate individual who no longer has those mental challenges and you can therefore talk <br>
    
    <br>

    Confidentally. I'm writing a Blog on this Because I'm facinated on just how amazing the human brain is at times. What I've just described here is called The "Alter ego effect" and it is <br>
    Among the many of things that make Humans different from other Animals and our ancestors and just because the book is so good here it is what its called:

    I mean it when its good! Its actually among one of the only books I've actually read from cover to cover.

    Recently (Or more specifically a week ago so however 'recent' it was) I caught a flu (probably from the convention) that took place. It sucked really bad. Like really bad. <br>
    But despite that simple fact it only lasted for a couple days before I started to feel much better. As if right now as Im writing this I feel completely fine. However I started to <br>
    Notice something new. I was no longer cognitively.. there..? My memory recall is not as good, My Cognitive thinking is slower, it takes longer to have information processed. <br>
    Its driving me crazy. I really hope its nothing serious and its just my body fighting off the rest of the flu..

    Wow.. It is extremely weird to be writing "2025" on here. Almost just typed in 2024. I haven't wrote any serious posts in a little while now. Recently life has been doing <br>
    What life does best. I finally was able to get this site off the onion and switch to a much better alternative. In case your not familar, This Blog used to be an onionsite <br>
    (a "Darkweb" website in normie terms accessed using tor browser). I swear it was nothing illegal, I just so happened to have a spare thinkpad that I could run 24/7 and so I <br>
    kept the site running on there. Creating onionsites are much easier than hosting on the clearweb. But here we are! Haven't really been doing much, Was finally able to get <br>
    out of a pretty bad burnout. I have a cycle I go through every year or 2. I get super hyperfixed on a project of mine, Then I crashed and burned out. Sadly its not even <br>
    something I can help other than to just force myself to stop once I notice myself withdrawing from social activities. I have been learning OpenGL and actually sticking <br>
    with it. Been Learning a lot about Graphics and the Way engines communicate with the game. Most Engine's these days use Graphics APIs Such as OpenGL Vulkan or even DirectX <br>
    in older Engines. Since this is on Neocities I might play around with WebGL more. Tor didn't allow javascript for security reasons. <br>

    gl.viewport(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    
    gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
    </script>
    But yeah, I have new stuff going on. Back on the Engine grind. The idea is to have a OpenGL Game Engine out with a basic but pretty scene. As well as a Map Editor thats simple yet <br>
    Gives you enough tools to make very complex scenery.
